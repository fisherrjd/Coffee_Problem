# Bertram Labs Coffee Challenge

## The Story

Bob, Jeremy, and the other 5 coworkers in the Bertram Labs office love coffee. In fact, every day, right after lunch, they walk down the street to their favorite coffee shop to grab a cup to go.

- Bob always gets a cappuccino.
- Jeremy likes his coffee black.
- The others have their favorite coffee beverages too.

To ease the checkout process, only **one coworker pays** for all the coffees each day. As you can imagine, they face a problem every day: **"Who's turn is it to pay for coffee?"**

## The Challenge

Write a software program to help the coworkers decide who should pay for coffee.

**Important Consideration:**  
Not all drinks cost the same â€” so to be fair, your solution should take this into account when determining whose turn it is to pay.

## Requirements

- Choose any programming language you like!
- Use any tools that you like, including AI.
- Create any interface you like (e.g., GUI, CLI).
- Your solution must be published to GitHub.
  - *Note:* If you advance in the interview process, the team will want to hear about:
    - Your development process
    - Why you chose specific tools, interface, and programming language

## Deliverables

1. **Instructions** on how to build and run your solution (preferably in a README)
2. Document any **assumptions** made during your program's design
3. If needed, document **how to enter required data**, such as:
   - Who the coffee consumers are
   - The price of each person's usual coffee
4. Provide the finished software solution so it can be run **locally** or accessed **online**

## Deliverables

1. **Instructions** on how to build and run your solution (preferably in a README)
2. Document any **assumptions** made during your program's design
3. If needed, document **how to enter required data**, such as:
   - Who the coffee consumers are
   - The price of each person's usual coffee
4. Provide the finished software solution so it can be run **locally** or accessed **online**

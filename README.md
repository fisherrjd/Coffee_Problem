# TODO

1. python backend api
    - pydantic
    - fastapi
2. Some form of front end?
    - TODO - look at good ideas more than CLI (its a full stack position not just backend)

3. Data Storage
    - Flat file?
    - DB?

4. Algorithim for "fairness"
    - Bertram always pays
    - percentage chance based off fraction of pot
    - pot balance pay what you owe over time ~= cost of your drinks
